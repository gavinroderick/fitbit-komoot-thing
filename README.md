# Untitled Tree Thing API


## Techy Details
> Section to talk a bit about the techy side of this project, what I enjoyed. Mainly a braindump space for me so I can reflect on the project later.

### Things I enjoyed, found notable or am generally happy with

####Â Soft Delete / Global Query Filters
https://stackoverflow.com/a/65702479
I've missed using GQF's while I've been in Node land - so was keen to use them again here. Initially I was just going to apply them to each model individually,
but wanted to see if there was a better way to just apply the filter to everything that uses `BaseModel`

Don't think I've ever knowingly used reflection, but apparently this is it. Seems like a nice, neat way to achieve what I want.

#### Exception Handling Middleware

Was fun to write some middleware for the first time in .NET really. This is somewhere I've more experience in JS, feels weird to be porting knowledge back that way.
